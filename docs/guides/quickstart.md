# Quickstart

Install the LynxKite application with `pip`:
```bash
pip install lynxkite
```

To be able to do anything useful, you also need to install one or more LynxKite environments.
If you want to work with data science and graph analytics, install the `lynxkite-graph-analytics` package:
```bash
pip install lynxkite-graph-analytics
```

Create a folder for storing your LynxKite projects:
```bash
mkdir ~/lynxkite_projects
```

You're ready to run LynxKite!
```bash
cd ~/lynxkite_projects
lynxkite
```

Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.

Find example workspaces in the [`examples` folder](https://github.com/lynxkite/lynxkite-2000/tree/main/examples).
